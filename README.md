### Hi there 👋

My interest ranges from [topological physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_order) 🪢 to [carnatic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music)🎻. I currently work at the very exciting intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. 

Here are two of works that might interest you 🗿: 

- [Can you use quantum computers to price call and put stock options ? - arXiv:2101.04280](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04280)
- [How mathamatically bad (or good?) is it to be vague on your stance in political elections ? - arXiv:2009.05198](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05198)
